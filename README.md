# Geek_Date
Basic structure for a dating app based on fandoms  
Take a sort survey about which fandoms you align with and find a match from the database in friends.js
my next steps:
    1) expand questionaire to add more fandoms and more personal information and preferences 
    2) set up login and authentication 
    3) add location services 
    4) add choice of matching with male, female, or either 
    5) create user data storage to match real people based on their fandoms
    6) create a chat feature for matches to connect
    7) mobile responsive 
    8) create app version for iphone and android 
    9) world domination
